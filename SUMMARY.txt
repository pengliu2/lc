* best time to buy and sell stock:
** I have a leetcode session for this
** totally 6 questions
   - one transaction
   - 2 transactions
   - k transactions
   - with transaction fee
   - with cooldown

* union find
** several different types
   - find a cycle: Redundant Connection
   - separate lands: Couples Holding Hands, Friend Circles
   - compute connected node's numder: Longest Consecutive Sequence

** find a cycle:
   - like Redundant Connection, even the problem description
     states the rules define a tree. Actually it doesn't matter, tree
     here only means all nodes connect without circle.
   - so adding rules just mean to have another way to connect some
     subsets of all nodes together
   - so if there's a root for each side of the rule, that means they
     belong to those smaller trees, let one tree's root's parent
     another tree's root, then all nodes can find their common root
     and know they are connected

** compute connected node's number: Longest Consecutive Sequence
   - have to keep immediate parent for each node like in finding a circyle
   - because we haven't iterate all nodes to compute length
